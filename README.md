The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. Are  vehicle weight, the angle of the spoiler, and whether it was all wheel drive or not. While on the other hand, vehicle length and ground clearance had the most amount of random variance. 

The p-value of the model happens to be really small. 5.35e-11 therefore one would reject the null hypothesis. Which would imply that the slope would be a flat line given that it's not zero.   

For the most part this linear model does predict the mpg of the Mecha car prototypes. Seeing that the R-squared value is 0.7149 or about 71%

The current data shows that lots one and two meet the specifications of not exceeding 100lbs per square inch. While lot 3 exceeds those parameters.
